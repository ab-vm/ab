# `om`: The Object Model Library

`om` is a C++ library implementing a GC and object model. `om` is built on the OMR GC framework. `om` is particularly suited for dynamic, javascript-like languages.

`om` is intended to be easy to use and feature full.

## Requirements

* `pith`

## Usage:
```C++
int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
	// TODO: Basic API sample for om
	return 0
}
```
