/***
 * NOTE: The OMR VM access model grants exclusive VM access to one thread
 * only if no other thread has VM access. Conversely one or more threads may
 * be granted shared VM access only if no other thread holds exclusive
 * VM access. This can be modeled as a write-bias reader/writer lock where
 * threads holding shared VM access periodically check for pending
 * requests for exclusive VM access and relinquish VM access in that event.
 *
 * It is assumed that a thread owning the exclusive lock may attempt to
 * reacquire exclusive access when it already has exclusive access. Each
 * OMR thread maintains a counter to track the number of times it has acquired
 * the lock and not released it. This counter (OMR_VMThread::exclusiveCount)
 * must be maintained in the language-specific environment language interface
 * (this file).
 *
 * OMR threads must acquire shared VM access and hold it as long as they are
 * accessing VM internal structures. In the event that another thread requests
 * exclusive VM access, threads holding shared VM access must release shared
 * VM access and suspend activities involving direct access to VM structures.
 *
 * This (example) environment delegate implements a simplistic VM access framework
 * that is not pre-emptive; that is, it relies on threads that are holding non-
 * exclusive VM access to check frequently (sub-millisecond) whether any other
 * thread is requesting exclusive VM access and release non-exclusive VM
 * access immediately in that event. Continuity of VM access can be ensured by
 * reacquiring non-exclusive VM access immediately after releasing it.
