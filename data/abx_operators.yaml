### Listing of INTERNAL executable operators.

## WASM expressions are rewritten to an internal representation to facilitate
## execution. This document lists the internal operators in Ab. The operators
## are closely related their WaSM

## - no nop, block, or end operator
## - branches are translated to relative gotos
## - table based branches are rewritten to 

### Standard Opcodes
